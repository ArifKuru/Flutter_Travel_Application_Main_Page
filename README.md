# Flutter Travel Application Main Page

This is a simple travel application main page built using Flutter. It requires a database for countries and utilizes the Google Maps API for the maps feature and Places API for nearby places. The page is designed to be responsive and can be used on all kinds of screens, thanks to the use of padding, margin, alignment geometries, and the SafeArea widget during the design process.
